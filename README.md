## How to Submit an Issue Like A Boss!

_How-TO type questions are better suited to forums such as [REDDIT](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/new/).
There is a much larger audience of people that have probably
already been through and resolved the same issue._

Make sure you have reviewed the [documentation](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/tree/master/doc) on the Github as well as running:
```
	XMR-STAK --help
```
**^^ This will answer most How-TO type questions. ^^**
