## How to Submit an Issue Like A Boss!
---
**_How-TO and tuning your hardware is not within the scope of Github support and will most likely be ignored._**

_How-TO and tuning type questions are better suited to forums such as [REDDIT/r/moneromining](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/new/).
There is a much larger audience of people that have probably
already been through and resolved the same issue._

Make sure you have reviewed the [documentation](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/tree/master/doc) on the Github as well as running:
```
	xmr-stak --help
```
**^^ This will answer most How-TO type questions. ^^**

#### What you should be doing to make this go as smoothly as possible

Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#) (formatting) for logs or code that you post in an Issue ticket.  
You will look like a genius and make the text you paste in actually readable! Win! Win!  
Below is a simple example of how to create a code box for your logs/code:

```  
` ` `  
if (isAwesome){  
    return true  
}  
` ` `  
```
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#) explains this much better so please take a minurte to review it.  

1. Choose a simple, clear title for your Issue Subject
2. Stick to one problem per issue report.
3. Describe the issue clearly.

    a. A short synopsis of what is happening.
    
    b. What you expect should be happening.
    
    c. Exact error message(s), if any.

	d. Include screenshots and/or logs of the issue.
    
	e. If useful, edit the screenshot with circles or arrows to highlight the error.
    
4. Describe what steps you have performed in an attempt to resolve the issue.
5. Complete the applicable template section(s) below:  
  
_**Please provide as much as possible information to reproduce the issue. Use the section that applies to your issue.**_  
  
6. If you resolved your issue please note what you did in the Issue ticket so others may benefit from your success!
7. If you resolved your issue please close it. It would really help us out!

Don't be _**that guy**_ and jump into an Issue with your isuue unless it is exactly the same. It just confuses the whole situation.
